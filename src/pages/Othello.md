longDesc: "This was a Scrum based team project in which three other teammates, and I recreated a popular board game Othello in PyGame. The project had two sprint cycles, each two week long and it focused on slowing building a working model of the game. In the first sprint we focused on getting the basic functionality of the game to work, which included coding in the rules of the game, setting up the board, placing pieces etc. The second sprint was focused on adding additional features like selecting difficulty, background color, undoing moves, playing with the computer and playing with two people. We divided the tasks into components based on user stories and set the tasks up on a Trello board. The tasks were given a deadline and points based on the difficulty of the task."
